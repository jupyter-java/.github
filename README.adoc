# Jupyter Java

Welcome to Jupyter Java, a GitHub organization created to simplify the discovery of various ways to use Java with Jupyter notebooks. We're not here to start a Java vs Python debate, we're all about the love of coding, regardless of the language! So, let's keep it light-hearted and fun.

We provide JBang scripts to set up and install various Jupyter kernels, along with Docker images for easy execution in various Jupyter environments. Enjoy exploring!

## Installing Jupyter Kernels

The simplest way to run Java based Jupyter kernels is to install https://jbang.dev[JBang] and run the following:

```bash
jbang install-kernel@jupyter-java
```

It will install a default kernel which is then available locally on your computer.
This can then be used in your local Jupyter install.
