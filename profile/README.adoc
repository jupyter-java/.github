Welcome to Jupyter Java, a GitHub organization created to simplify the discovery of various ways to use Java with Jupyter notebooks. We're not here to start a Java vs Python debate, we're all about the love of coding, regardless of the language! So, let's keep it light-hearted and fun.

We provide JBang scripts to set up and install various Jupyter kernels, along with Docker images for easy execution in various Jupyter environments. Enjoy exploring!

## Installing Jupyter Kernels

The simplest way to run Java based Jupyter kernels is to install https://jbang.dev[JBang] and run the following:

```bash
jbang install-kernel@jupyter-java
```

It will install a default IJava kernel which is then available locally on your computer.
This can then be used in your local Jupyter install or via editors that support jupyter notebook such as vscode, intellij etc.

There are other kernels available you can provide as arguments to the install-kernel command:

- `ijava`
- `rapaio`
- `ganymede`
